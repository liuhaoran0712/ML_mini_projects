- Repository containing several mini projects, implementing small scale ML training models using scikit-learn, tensorflow and kern. Mainly for fun and learning.

- Folders specific to separate techniques and softwares used.  
- All packages are based on python, mostly written in the form of  JUPYTER notebooks.  
- Many examples coming from *Aurélien Géron - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2019, O’Reilly Media)* and other relevant books on practical machine learning. 
- Separate readme files might be added to folders, whereever deemed necessary.

# ML_mini_projects  using anaconda
- Repository containing several mini projects, implementing small scale ML training models using scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch. Mainly for fun and learning. 
- All instructions are with respect to a terminal in linux/mac. Please use the ubuntu sub-system if you are using windows 10 or use anaconda for windows. A good installation guide for the linux sub-system can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- Folders specific to separate techniques and softwares used.  
- Highly recommends installing anaconda  to handle the packages and their dependencies. 
- Instructions on installation of specific packages in anaconda included in readme.md files.
- All packages are based on python, mostly written in the form of  JUPYTER notebooks.  
- Many examples taken from *Aurélien Géron - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems (2019, O’Reilly Media)* and other relevant books on practical machine learning. 
- Separate readme files might be added to folders, whereever deemed necessary.

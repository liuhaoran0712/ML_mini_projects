# Introduction to TensorFLow2 lower lewel API

- We discuss some features and syntax for TensorFlow lower level API.
- This will be useful in understanding how TensorFlow functions and graphs works, which will inturn helps with debugging.
- Also it will aid in making custom layers and models using class inheritence, in case we need more freedom  and control, than the ones available in higher level APIs like Keras.
- In particular, we discuss different tf datastructures, operations, subclass structure of some keras subclasses.
- We also discussion TF's auto graphing and tracing functionality.

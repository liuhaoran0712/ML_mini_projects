# House pricing prediction using sequential api in Keras: TensorFlow
## What's new?
- First multi layer Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to be implemented in this series. 
- Image classifier using a shallow (two layer) feed-forward ANN.
- keras.models.Sequential() class is used to define a simple sequential feed forward network.
- Saving and loading the model using Keras inbuild method. 
- See the notebook for more details.

    "# House pricing prediction using shallow ANN and functional api in Keras: TensorFlow\n",
    "- Multi-input, multi-output regression with wide and deep ANNs are implemented.  \n",
    "- Possiblity of using a __subclass__ API is also dicussed towards the end.\n",
    "- Using __callbacks__ method to save checkpoints and early termination of training is discussed.\n",
    "- __TensorBoard__- for visualization is discussed.\n",
    "- A section on __hyperparameter tuning__ like deciding on number of deep layers, no. of neutrons in each layer, etc.  \n",
    "- This is a practice project where a shallow ANN is trained and  deployed for predicting **housing prices**  based on  the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository2. This dataset is based on data from the 1990 California census. \n",
    "- The project follows the suggestions from Chapter 10 of “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly). Copyright 2019 Kiwisoft S.A.S., 978-1-492-03264-9.” \n"

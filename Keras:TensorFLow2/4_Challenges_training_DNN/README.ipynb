    "- In practice, while training a deep neural network (ANNs with higher number of layers), you might run into some hurdles. \n",
    "- Since more often that not we problems we are trying to solve/predict are complex enought to warrant for a deep neural network, its worth addressing the issues with training of deep neural nets and how to rectify these issues.\n",
    "- In particular we discuss the theoretical strategies to tackle this issues and how to implement these strategies using Keras.\n",
    "- This section takes most of the material and example from Chapter.11 of “ Chapter 10 : Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly). Copyright 2019 Kiwisoft S.A.S., 978-1-492-03264-9.”. \n",
    "- As always, we are skipping the mathematical justification behind each strategy and instead focus on implementation. The book mentioned above has excellent references (mostly publications where these results are published). So if you feel like you need the mathematical reasoning behind any of the strategies, I would strongly encourage you to take a look at these references. \n",
    "- Note that we wont be doing an end to end modelling and training and hence this section is a fairly short read."
